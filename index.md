## Developed for Independent Investigators

You can use my software for your independent investigations. Usually, investigation software costs are not cheap. I made my software free. Now, who is II's (Independent Investigators)? They are usually regular people turned investigators for a reason. However, they are not associating with the authorities like a Private Investigator or even available to be hired by the authorities. They work alone, they are somewhat a vigilante except for the killing part. That is the choice that they will make which will turn them into one. However, my software was designed to help II's (Independent Investigators) not vigilantes. Their end goal is to investigate then reach out with their hard evidence and give it over to the authorities. Hopefully, they made copies, these days you can not trust anyone.
